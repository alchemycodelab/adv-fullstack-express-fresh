# Express-Fresh

This is a minimal setup for an Express server that hosts static assets generated
from Webpack. When running locally, use http://localhost:8000. The default
deployed app is http://localhost:8001.

Some TODOs:
1. Split commits up (perhaps in a new repo or branch?) to show each feature
   added slowly.
2. Add more comments describing what things are for, for offline view.
3. Add some links to documentation of relevance.
4. Add deployment.
